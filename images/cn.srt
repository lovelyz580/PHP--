《1. Video and Audio Basics》
-----本字幕由雷天音 整理制作-----
At this point with all the discussion around it, it would be hard to believe

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,200
【----QQ 568031962----】
that you've never heard of HTML5 video.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,200
【----ACELY STUDIO----】
Still I think to dive into what HTML5 video is exactly would be useful.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,200
HTML5 video is the future of video playback on the web.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,200
You can see in this chart that I believe somewhere around 2015 HTML5

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,200
video will be the primary method for video playback on the web. Looking back,

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,200
when video started with plug-ins like Real Player, QuickTime and Windows Media Player,

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,200
there wasn't a clearly dominant plug-in at the time so what developers would

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,200
often try to support all three, to make sure video could reach as much of their

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,200
audience as possible.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Then Flash came on the scene and was able to gain a high enough level of

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200
user adoption that Web developers could support almost all their audience

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
just through Flash.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,200
To this day Flash has a solid lead over other plug-ins in both user support and

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200
web developers using it for video playback.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Now very much thanks to Flash video has become an integral part of the web.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,200
According to comScore, 83.5% of Internet users viewed online video in March 2011.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,200
During the rise of Flash and video on the web, browser developers recognized the

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,200
importance of video and started tossing around the idea of making video a native

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,200
part of HTML and the browser experience just like text and images.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,200
In 2007, the developers of the Opera web browser released a version of Opera

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,200
that included support for a video tag that mimicked the image tag and would play

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,200
back video in the browser using a built-in video player as opposed to a plug-in.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,200
From this the specification for an HTML video tag was born. In the following

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,200
years rather developers and other interested parties continue to refine the

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,200
specification and other browsers besides Opera began building in their own video

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
players and support for the video tag.

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Now a very important distinction should be pulled from this.

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,200
With HTML5 video each web browser is building their own video player, which means

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,200
one browser's video player could be very different from the next.

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,200
One of the benefits of Flash is that since it's a plug-in, it's basically the

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,200
same code running in each browser and from the most part you can expect Flash

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,200
video in Internet Explorer to work the same as it does in Firefox.

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
With HTML5 video, video could work differently in each browser because each

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,200
browser vendor is building their own player.

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Different styles of controls in each browser illustrate this point.

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
You can see they look very different.

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,200
But despite the fact that they look different, they all have the same basic

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
controls and work as expected.

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
This is where the importance of standards comes in.

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,200
That specification for the HTML video tag that I mentioned is instructions for

42
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,200
browser developers on how the video tag should work.

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,200
And for the most part, they've all done a great job of following these

44
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,200
instructions, aside from certain browsers not supporting specific features quite yet.

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,200
When they do support a feature, they all support it in basically same way.

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,200
So we can expect the video tag to work the same in all browsers.

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
This is great because we all know what it's like when browsers don't work the same way.

48
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,200
If you're interested you can read the video tag specifications on either the W3C

49
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,200
site or the WHATWG site.

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Both are basically the same and they are actually maintained by the same person.

51
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,200
WHATWG site I believe tends to have the most recent information, but is also

52
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,200
more likely to change, whereas the W3C version is more locked down.

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,200
But remember these are instructions for the browser developers and not

54
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
necessarily for us as web developers, though it's a great resource for us to see

55
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
how the video tag should work.

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,200
So I have talked a lot about HTML5 video specifically but what about HTML5 audio?

57
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,200
So it's called HTML5: Video and Audio in Depth, right?

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Well, HTML5 audio is basically the little brother of HTML5 video.

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,200
They are both built on top of the same parent element, the media element, which

60
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
means they share the same DNA.

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,200
In fact I don't believe there's any attribute of the audio element that can't

62
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
be found in the video element as well, except for these specific file types

63
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,200
that the audio element supports. Which makes sense because videos also have

64
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,200
audio in them, but there are a number of attributes that the video element has

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
and audio doesn't. And they all center around the fact that you're also viewing

66
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
something at the same time.

67
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,200
It includes things like an option for poster frame or setting the width and

68
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
height of the viewable area.

69
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,200
So there may be times where I focus on video and don't mention audio just because

70
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,200
so much of what applies to video also applies to audio and in those cases you

71
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,200
can assume that what I am talking about also applies to audio.

72
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,200
But I'll be sure to include discussions and examples of audio whenever it would

73
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,200
be helpful and especially wherever there are differences.

74
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
So that's a pretty good background on what HTML5 video and audio are and there

75
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
is a good chance a lot of that isn't new to you.

76
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,200
But what can be unclear is where HTML5 is in the process of becoming that

77
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,200
-----本字幕由雷天音 整理制作-----

primary media playback technology and what workarounds are required to make it a reality today.

78
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,200
So next, I am going to discuss the state of HTML5 video and audio.
